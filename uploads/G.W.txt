George Washington was born on February 22, 1732, in Westmoreland County, Virginia. He grew up in colonial Virginia on a plantation and lost his father at a young age. As a teenager, he worked as a land surveyor, which gave him experience on the frontier and helped him build a reputation as a hardworking and capable young man. In his early twenties, he joined the Virginia militia and played a role in the French and Indian War. Though some of his early military actions were controversial, he showed leadership under pressure and began building the reputation that would eventually make him a national figure.

As tensions between the American colonies and Britain grew in the 1760s and 1770s, Washington became more involved in politics. He was elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses and became increasingly critical of British policies like the Stamp Act and the Tea Act. In 1775, as the colonies prepared for war with Britain, the Second Continental Congress appointed him as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. He led the American forces throughout the Revolutionary War, facing enormous challenges, including lack of supplies, harsh winters, and a more experienced British military. Despite setbacks, Washington held the army together and secured key victories, such as the surprise attack at Trenton in 1776 and the decisive victory at Yorktown in 1781, which effectively ended the war.

After the war, Washington shocked the world by voluntarily giving up power and resigning his military commission-something few leaders in history had done. He returned to his home at Mount Vernon, but he was soon called back to public life. In 1787, he presided over the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, where the U.S. Constitution was written. Two years later, he was unanimously elected as the first President of the United States in 1789 and was re-elected in 1792. As president, Washington helped shape the new government, set important precedents (like the two-term limit), and tried to keep the country neutral in foreign conflicts. His leadership was widely respected, and he played a major role in unifying the young nation.

Washington retired from the presidency in 1797 and returned once again to Mount Vernon. He died there on December 14, 1799, at the age of 67. His death was mourned across the country, and he is remembered as the “Father of His Country” for his role in winning independence and helping to found the United States. To this day, Washington is honored as one of the greatest and most admired figures in American history, known for his integrity, leadership, and commitment to democratic principles.
